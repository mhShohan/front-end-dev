# Schulte Table

### Schulte tables are tables with randomly arranged characters, usually numbers or letters used to check and develop the speed of their visual search in a specific order. These tables were originally developed by the German psychotherapist Walter Schulte as a psychodiagnostic test for studying the properties of attention.
